# Trivia Game

A single page application that shows trivia questions fetched from OpenTDB. The application is built with React.js and utilizes multiple of the framework's hooks. The project is made both with user- and developer experience in mind.

The deployed website can be found [here](https://zkkv.github.io/trivia-game/)

P.S. Answer all five questions correctly and get a surprise ;)
